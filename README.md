# Vertux_Vertusa
This project focuses on implementing algorithms to find the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) of vertices in a graph. The Maximal Independent Set is a subset of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent, and no additional vertices can be added without breaking this property.
